For A, think how much time you can spend daily. Is it good enough to achieve the goal? How will you know you could achieve the goal? DO NOT RESUBMIT. Do it for yourself.","One of the most essential tasks for any group to be successful is proper goal setting. It is 
important to work with your fellow student leaders and adviser to determine the goals 
that your student organization will work towards this year. Spend an adequate amount of 
time for brainstorming and then dialoguing on the goals. Try to establish one or two 
objectives that will help you achieve those goals as well. Remember to keep these goals 
written down and refer to them at various points throughout the year. Don’t lose sight of 
your goals; if you manage to keep them in mind, you’ll be that much closer to achieving 
them!
Making S.M.A.R.T. Goals
S.M.A.R.T. Goals Are:
Specific-they are clear and direct
Measurable-helps in creating objectives to reach the goal
Action-oriented-they are something to work towards
Realistic-they need to be something that can be obtained
Timely-groups should set time limits and try to stick to them

The benefits of goal setting are real and significant. Goal-setting applies both to you as 
an individual and to a group that sets goals.
1. Improves your self-image (or the self-image of the group).
2. Makes you aware of your strengths, which can be used to overcome obstacles and 
provide solutions to problems. (The same is true for the group.)
3. Makes you aware of your weaknesses so you can begin to improve them and make 
them into your strengths.
